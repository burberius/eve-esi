# EVE-ESI
A Java client library for the EVE Swagger Interface (ESI)

## Version 3.0.0 changes
After several years with many changes to ESI it is now quite stable, so
we decided to move to a (hopefully) better and especially threadsafe http library: **okhttp**

This version also changes how the *ApiClient* is initialized, it now uses a
builder *ApiClientBuilder* to create the *ApiClient* the right way. Here are two examples:

```java
ApiClient client = new ApiClientBuilder().clientID(clientId).accessToken("some-access-token").build();

ApiClient client = new ApiClientBuilder().clientID(clientId).refreshToken("some-refresh-token").build();
```

For more, please have a look in the tests.

## Maven integration
Just add the following to your *pom.xml*:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.troja.eve</groupId>
    <artifactId>eve-esi</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)

- Major
  - Major breaking changes to the entire library
  - May also contain endpoint promotions and bug fixes
- Minor
  - Endpoint promotions ([breaking changes](https://github.com/esi/esi-docs/blob/master/docs/breaking_changes.md]) announced in the [esi changelog](https://github.com/esi/esi-issues/blob/master/changelog.md))
  - May also contain bug fixes
- Patch
  - Bug fixes without any breaking changes

## SSO usage
The usage of the SSO can be seen in the *main* method within the test class
*net/troja/eve/esi/api/auth/SsoAuthTest.java*.

**Note:** The state should be some secret to prevent XRSF, please read:
http://www.thread-safe.com/2014/05/the-correct-use-of-state-parameter-in.html

## Tests with authorization
To run the tests that use authorization you need to have some environment variables set,
this information should not be published:
* SSO_CLIENT_ID
* SSO_REFRESH_TOKEN

Client id can be created on the following page: https://developers.eveonline.com/
You should use http://localhost as redirect url as that is the value used in the test and it also
makes it easier after the redirect.

### Create a refresh token for the tests
To create a refresh token, you have to start the class *net/troja/eve/esi/api/auth/SsoAuthTest.java*
with your client id as the argument or set the environment variables `SSO_CLIENT_ID`.

The url will open in your browser, login with your account and authorize the access. This will redirect you
to an url on localhost, something like:
```
http://localhost/?code=7z524J_PQZ1YjacS35d8JRkOVwNl-jCvn814xCrgeSm3Acc981lZWW0&state=somesecret
```

Copy the *code* part to console and press enter. As result you will get a refresh token, that can be
used to run the tests.

Example output:
```shell
Authorization URL: https://login.eveonline.com/oauth/authorize?scope=esi-clones.read_clones.v1&response_type=code&state=somesecret&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost&client_id=352ef22ca74e33c78c11779ab3saffe
Code from Answer: 7z524J_PQZ1YjacS35d8JRkOVwNl-jCvn814xCrgeSm3Acc981lZWW0
Refresh Token: 0tr5SQ-piuKvqjFdDa765DESObTzWKUj5v63KjaL4cTAx041
```
## Tipps 'n' Tricks

### Paging
If you wonder how the paging with esi works, please have a look at the test
*[src/test/java/net/troja/eve/esi/api/MarketApiTest.java](https://github.com/burberius/eve-esi/blob/master/src/test/java/net/troja/eve/esi/api/MarketApiTest.java#L234)* there is a method *pagingExample* showing it.

## Development on windows

### Setup
1) Download Cygwin from: https://www.cygwin.com
2) Install Cygwin with the default options
3) Run the Cygwin installer again and add: wget (web), git (devel), jq (text)
4) Download maven from: http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi (if you don't have it installed already)
5) Unpack and add the "bin" directory to windows environment variable "path"
6) Download and install Java SE JDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html (if you don't have it installed already)

### Generate new source
1) Start the Cygwin Terminal
2) ``cd`` to the source
